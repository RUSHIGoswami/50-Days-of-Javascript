# Day 7

<br>
Today, I have made the split landing page.<br>
In today's practice I used more of css and less of javascript.<br>
simple <b>css</b> concepts like working with custom properties with root scope, translate functions, transition properties and  media queries for responsiveness are used in today's practice.</br>
where in <b>javascript</b> , I applied simple concepts like grabing classes using queryselector, adding EventListners (mouse enter & mouse leave) and adding classes.<br>
