# Day 6

<br>
Today, I have made the Scroll animation.<br>
I used <b>css</b> simple concept of tranlateX and transform, where in <b>javascript</b> , I applied window event listeners and a function "getBoundingClientRect" which returns a <b>DOMRect</b> object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport..<br>
