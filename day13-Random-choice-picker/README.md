# Day 13

Today, I have made Random Choice picker<br> Here, I am taking input from textarea and splitting it
with comma(,) using **split()** then trimming the whitespaces using **trim()** and converting it
into array.<br>I have added an eventlistner "keyup" to the textarea so whatever I write as input it
shows below as choices.<br>When "keyup" is equal to Enter key, I'm running randomselect function
with some delay (using **setTimeout() & setInterval()**) and this function picks random choice from
given input and highlights that choice.<br>
