# Day 8

<br>
Today, I have made the Form wave Animation.<br>
Today I created just a simple login form and beautified it with css<br>Then using css pseudo-classes like focus, valid I have given some transform animation like moving the label in wavy pattern with transition delay using time-animation function called cubic-bezier().<br> 
Now comes the main part of Javascript- using js I grabbed labels and by iterating it with Foreach loop I changed its innerHTML and converted labels to different spans of letters using methods like split(), map() and join().<br>
split('')- this method splits a string into an array of substrings.;<br>
map()- this method takes the arrow functions as an argument and creates a new array from calling a function for every array element;<br>
join('')- this method returns an array as a string;<br>
