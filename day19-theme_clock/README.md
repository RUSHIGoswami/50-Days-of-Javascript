# Day 19

Today, I have made the Theme Clock.<br> I used js concepts like querySelector, addEventlistener,
classList, Date properties and functions like getMonth(), getDay(), getHours() and Scale function
which maps given range to specified range.<br> I used CSS properties like root scope properties,
flexbox, pseudo selector focus, transform property and rotate function.<br>
