# Day16

Today, I have made Drink water, which how much water you drank & how much is remaining.<br> In
Javascript I applied concepts like getElementById, querySelectorAll, forEach, addEventListener and
some user defined functions which I made for calculations and highlighting the cups.<br> Where in
CSS I used flexbox, root scope properties.<br>
