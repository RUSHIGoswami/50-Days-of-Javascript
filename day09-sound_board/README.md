# Day 9

Today, I have made the Sount Board.<br>
I have used HTML5 audio tag here for audio files and used simple css to beatify it. In Javscript part i created a simple node list of sound names and iterated it with forEach loop then added click eventlistener to play sound using audio function play() and to stop the sound I used audio function pause() and making currentTime property `0`so when you press another button then other sound should be stopped.So far this was something new to learn.
