Here I will upload my daily practice work for mastering Javascript for 50 days.


# Day 1
Today, I have done sliding cards using simple Javascript concepts like grabing classes (Queryselectorall), adding/removing class (classList.add or .remove) conditionally (if statement) there are also some important concepts of css like use of flexbox and var().
