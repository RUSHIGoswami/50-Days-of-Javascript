# Day 10

Today, I have made the Dad Jokes with HTTP api.<br>
I have used <https://icanhazdadjoke.com/> api to fetch the jokes in json format using headers ("Accept") and fetch() methods and to show these jokes on container I used async await concept of javascript.<br>I have added eventlistener to button so by clicking it, it will show another joke.<br>
